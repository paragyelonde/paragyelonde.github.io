The day before the seventh day of the seventh anniversary of 2013 (okay...) I suddenly saw a page on Weibo.
At that time, my partner and I were shocked! This this! It’s good to be a celebration for someone! (Although it is inevitable to do this thing *note the fate of orphan*)

Originally, I wanted to write a program to help me find the track of the birthday cake. Because the algorithm is too scum (捂脸) failed...
I had to retreat to create an awt application to record the mouse track... and then generated *6200+ coordinates... (but I also painted the birthday cake? Is it necessary to [contact me] (http:/ /weibo.cn/xavieryao))
After trying multiple Sizes, I have streamlined and processed the coordinates in the local... Although the CPU usage has increased to 40% on IE 11, it is as slow as ever on
